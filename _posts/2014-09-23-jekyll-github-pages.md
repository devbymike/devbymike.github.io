Recently I decided to migrate this website from WordPress to Jekyll and host it with [Github pages](https://github.com/devbymike/devbymike.github.io). 

The transition has been a smooth one with a small learning curve when compared to WordPress. And the speed of development is at least 5x as fast.

Having used WordPress since 2007 I had grown to dislike how bloated it’s felt with each new feature release. Since v3.0 it seems like WordPress has just been gaining weight and bloat.

Constantly needing to backup WordPress and install security updates and worrying about if a plugin will break my theme or not is another source of irritation for me.

So in order to branch out and learn something new, I decided to first [Get Good with Git](http://mikekey.com/rebooting-the-site/). And then try something new.

### Enter Jekyll.

When I learned about [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) it seemed like a great alternative. The site is static so it loads twice as fast as WordPress. No heavy database over head, no security updates to worry about. No heavy bloated backend.

All my posts are in Markdown, and I’ve been using iA Writer for awhile to write, so nothing new to learn there.

The fact that GitHub provides [free hosting for Jekyll blogs[(http://pages.github.com/) is just icing on the cake. It will save me some cash in hosting. GitHub provides automatic version control of my blog as well. I can use GitHub's web editor to write blog posts online. And I can still connect it to my custom domain ([devybymike.com](http://devbymike.com)).

So here it is, my first post, and the new site up and running.
