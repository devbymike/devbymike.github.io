We’ve got a real problem in this country with people and what they believe. No I’m NOT talking politics. We’ve bread a culture that believes things should be handed to them, that they no longer have to work hard for success, but that it should be handed to them.

This is a wrong way of thinking; one that needs to change. **If you want something, you’re going to have to go out and make it happen.**

I’m learning this first hand. For years I talked about business and being successful. In reality I was waiting for success to land in my lap. I was hoping it would be handed to me with the least effort possible, and in turn my first couple of businesses were mediocre. I applied the least amount of effort to everything I did.

And then one day a light bulb went off.

I’ve found a lot of success already, because I&#8217;m pouring blood, sweat and tears into making it happen. I&#8217;m getting out there and hitting the pavement, shaking hands, staying up late working on projects, making phone calls, doing follow ups, going to networking events, building my following on twitter, keeping up with it on facebook, etc. I’m putting in the work, not just sitting back and hoping it will come to me. I stay up late and fry my eyes with two 24inch computer screens, doing favors, hoping for some return. I&#8217;m taking a huge risk on all of this right now. [But with risk, comes great rewards][1]. If this thing is going to happen, I’m going to make it happen.

Now, here’s the deal. We all know this principle. So why are so many of you waiting around for success to land in your lap? Equally, why are so many of you thinking that you should be handed that next big promotion without doing any work?

If you want something, you’re going to have to pursue it. You’re going to have to bleed out of your eyeballs to make it happen. You’re going to have to be relentless in some cases. You’re friends will probably think you are crazy. Forget them. Your friends are probably losers anyways. Stop dreaming pie in the sky and start making the pie. (Does that even make sense?) You’ll probably have to get [outside your comfort zone][2] for starters.

My wife wants to buy a Hummer. A freaking Hummer in this economy! And guess what, she’s going to drive a freaking Hummer because **WE ARE GOING TO MAKE IT HAPPEN**.

Only one way that is going to happen. Not by me sitting around [hoping to get lucky][3], but by me getting out there and **MAKING IT HAPPEN**.

**Stop waiting for lady luck, get up off your ass and <span style="text-decoration: underline;">MAKE IT HAPPEN</span>**.

Word of the wise, there are [**NO SHORT CUTS**][4] to **SUCCESS**. So avoid the MLM’s.
