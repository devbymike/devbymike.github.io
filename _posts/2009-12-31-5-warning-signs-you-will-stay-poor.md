**Please be sure to share this important information with everyone you know!**

1.  ### You keep spending more than you earn.
    
    This one is a no brainier. **Every time you spend more money than you have earned, you are in debt.** If this is how you live, making $1.25 and spending a $1.50, you&#8217;ll always remain poor.</li> 
    *   ### Your wheels cost more than your car.
        
        <img class="alignright size-thumbnail wp-image-374" title="Bling Bling" src="http://www.mikekey.com/romans/wp-content/assets/2009/12/Picture-198-150x150.jpg" alt="Bling Bling" width="195" height="195" />You invested $4,000 dollars on a car worth $800 bucks. **When your financial priorities are out of balance it is guaranteed that you will not be acquiring wealth anytime soon.**
        
        Other examples include: No money to fix your car, but you  bought a new plasma television. You can&#8217;t pay child support, but you bought an &#8217;09 Corvette Z06. The power company turned off your lights because you didn&#8217;t pay your bill, but you&#8217;re wearing 80 dollar jeans so your butt will look good when you go out to the club.</li> 
        *   ### You believe there is a Conspiracy to Keep You Poor and Stupid, Aka Blame &#8220;The Man&#8221;
            
            **It&#8217;s up to you to educate yourself about finances and to do something about it.** ***Stop blaming someone else for your problems. **Stop blaming the government officials you elected. Stop blaming corporations. Stop blaming bad luck. Stop blaming the man in the sky. Stop blaming the credit card companies and your bank.  
            *
            
            * *
            
            It&#8217;s your own fault for getting yourself into debt.* *So long as you think that everyone else is out to keep you poor and dumb, you will remain poor.*  
            *</li> 
            *   ### You notice the “cost per month” price on items.
                
                **It should be obvious that if you can&#8217;t pay for it in cash, you can&#8217;t afford it.** If the only thing that matters when you go to buy something is what kind of payments you can make, then chances are you are going to remain poor.
                
                Consider this: you have just been promoted to manager at Kinko&#8217;s  and you are looking at a brand new BMW. The car salesmen tells you that you can drive this new car home today for only  $549 a month for  72 months. That&#8217;s a sweet deal! Heck the car is only 32K, and you make that in a year! Right?
                
                Here is why you are poor. That car will actually cost you in the long run a total of $39,562 at 7% APR. **That sweet deal actually cost you an additional ****$4,000. **</li> 
                *   ### You Keep spending money on Weed, Cigarettes, Beer or PORN.
                    
                    **<img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-317" title="Do you want to look like this guy?" src="http://www.mikekey.com/romans/wp-content/assets/2009/12/3310615095_e0fa3b4571_o.jpg" alt="Do you want to look like this guy?" width="195" height="210" />Nothing is more expensive than addictive habits. **Not only are they unhealthy, but they are keeping you in the poor house.
                    
                    A pack of cigarettes cost almost $5 on average—with some states tacking on additional taxes that raise the price. In New York City, for example, local taxes have pushed the cost of a pack to more than $10 in most stores. You are literally smoking your money every time you light one up.
                    
                    Making a habit out of getting high or drunk just to have fun will end up hurting your wallet in the long run. You don&#8217;t need to be hammered or stoned to enjoy life or to relax. If you have a real job (besides flipping burgers) you want to risk your income by doing drugs. Random drug screenings anyone?
                    
                    All to often, finance gurus fail to mention that **PORN**, a highly addictive and widely popular habit, is also a huge waste of your money.</li> </ol>
