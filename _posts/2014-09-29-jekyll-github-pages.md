This is nothing short of my first attempt at using Jekyll. Prior to playing with Jekyll I've been using WordPress since 2007 and I have dabbled with Statamic as well. Before trying out Jekyll I actually gave a go at Octopress.

To be honest, I didn't like Octopress one bit. I needed simpler, and the setup time out of the box with Jekyll is pretty quick. 

So here it is, my first post with Jekyll.
