It is a wonderful thing to dream, but it&#8217;s an even better thing to act upon those dreams. Throughout my life I&#8217;ve dreamed of a certain lifestyle, certain freedoms and the chance to do the extraordinary, but it wasn&#8217;t until after college that I realized dreams were just realities waited to be acted upon. This realization changed my life, up until about 21 I&#8217;d always assumed that you could *dream *but life happened to you regardless. This couldn&#8217;t be further from the truth and as I &#8216;wake up&#8217; more and more from the fog of &#8216;the real world&#8217; I see that your life can be as big as you dream it but your dreams can only be as big as you are willing to act upon.

This is actually reason for celebration, it means you don&#8217;t have to wake up everyday and think &#8216;what will life hand me today&#8217; instead you can literally happen to life, all it takes are baby steps. The way I act upon my dreams is three fold, I&#8217;ll explain my &#8216;action plan&#8217; below:

1.  **Quantify the dream. **Don&#8217;t say &#8216;I want to be rich and happy&#8217; you must find ways to measure how rich and what &#8216;happiness&#8217; looks like. So when you have a dream immediately put it onto paper and force yourself to quantify it. Now &#8216;I want to be rich and happy&#8217; turns into &#8216;I want to have $100,000 in the bank in 2 years and I want to have met and married my dream girl&#8217;.
2.  **Map out the dream.** So now that you know what &#8216;rich&#8217; and &#8216;happy&#8217; look like you can start to draw a plan (the more detailed the better) to get there. If you are driving somewhere you&#8217;ve never been you&#8217;d be a fool to not have a map (or mapquest) so why in life if you are heading towards a goal you&#8217;ve never achieved before would you leave the specifics to chance? It&#8217;s foolish, and more important it&#8217;s laziness masking itself with titles like &#8216;carefree&#8217;. So now assess your life as it stands, say you are working a job that pays $12 an hour part time, you aren&#8217;t going to get to your monetary goal this way so it&#8217;s time to change course. Develop an action plan based on what you like to do and what could possibly bring in extra income, then follow that plan to the T. What helps me is reading success stories, it not only inspires you but helps get your creative juices flowing about the *hows* of your specific goal. Secondly you want to meet and marry your dream girl, well if your single right now &#8211; or not with your dream girl &#8211; you&#8217;ll have to change course fast. Start meeting new people, go to a match maker, check out a dating site, ask your friends to set you up and actively search out the girl of your dreams vs. waiting on &#8216;chance&#8217;.
3.  **Live the dream. **Now as you act every day on these goals it is time to live &#8216;as if&#8217;, this means reminding yourself all the time of what your life will look like in 2 years and why you are going for those goals. It means not worry about finances or finding the right girl anymore because you *know* deep down in 2 years time you&#8217;ll be there. Thinking as if is a vital part of reaching your goals but must be paired with quantification and mapping out your dream&#8230; if it isn&#8217;t you aren&#8217;t &#8216;living as if&#8217; your delusional <img src="http://mikekey.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/icon_smile.gif" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" />

Now it&#8217;s time for you to act, comment below on at least one of your dreams and quantify it. In a month or so come back and reply with any progress you&#8217;ve made, this social pressure alone will help you push yourself out of your comfort zone and into the land of the *living*. It is time to seize your dreams, it&#8217;s time to stop moping and stop making excuses &#8211; nothing is impossible when you pair an ardent dream with incredible action.
