Last time I checked, no fat guys have made it to the top of Mount Everest, and that, my friends, is a problem for me. You see, since I came home in August from my summer adventure I&#8217;ve been addicted to energy drinks and junk food. Most of the time my breakfast would consist of  Mountain Dew, some M&Ms and a Peanut Butter and Jelly Sandwich. (That&#8217;s high-style living!)

I&#8217;ve been packing on the pounds, and I&#8217;m ashamed to admit I went from 150lbs to 175lbs, almost pushing 180lbs. I&#8217;ve been jamming all this junk into my veins thinking it&#8217;s keeping me sharp and on my game. With trying to start a new business, launch my personal brand and blog, and taking on consulting gigs all at the same time I need the **CAFFEINE**. In reality, this crap isn&#8217;t helping my game any. I&#8217;ve noticed a complete dwindling supply of creativity. Just look at my blog, my posts are getting less and less frequent.

To top it all off, this crap has some serious side effects to your health such as tooth decay, bone demineralization and the development of metabolic syndrome and diabetes. Constant sugar rushes from energy drinks are a major factor in the development of Type II diabetes. Evidence is starting to come out that high levels of sugar can even cause some neurological disorders.

As a entrepreneur, one should be conscience of their health and their body. When you feel your best, you&#8217;ll often give your best. A couple of years ago after a breakup with a long-term girlfriend I did a major detox. I unplugged for a whole month. No internet, no TV. I also gave up all the junk food and soda and started eating healthy and began jogging every day. All the TV and Internet time I replaced with reading up on all kinds of different things on self help and success. My mind was so sharp, and I was able to think clearer than ever.

Why did I stop? Well I got distracted by another girl. Go figure.

So being a fat fatty isn&#8217;t helping my business, and it isn&#8217;t helping my personal brand either. Ninja&#8217;s are not round. They are stealthy, agile and dangerous. And well, for the adventure seeker part, like I said, I am pretty sure there haven&#8217;t been any fat guys able to climb to the top of Everest.

Are you neglecting your health? What bad habits do you need to change right now to improve your life?

I&#8217;m declaring right here, publicly: I&#8217;m going to kick the caffeine starting today. I&#8217;m going to cut back on the unhealthy foods and start a work out program.

I&#8217;ll keep you all posted so you can keep me accountable.
