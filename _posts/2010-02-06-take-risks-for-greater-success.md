**Do you want more success?** Then you&#8217;re going to have to learn to [get outside your comfort zone][1] and start taking some risks! Rock Climbing is by nature a dangerous sport, but the pure thrill and rewards of scaling a mountain are well worth that risk.

***Often in our lives anything worth doing involves some level of risk***. Quiting your job to go start a business is risky, especially if you&#8217;ve got mouths to feed at home.  Just like in rock climbing, we can do things to minimize these risks, but ultimately, we are not fully in control.

**You have got to realize you can not control every aspect of life.** But if you let that fear of not being in control immobilize you, you will deny yourself the rewards that can come from taking great

risk and succeeding.

You&#8217;re bound to fail at some point, but you need to [step outside your comfort zone][2], embrace your fear and take some risks once in awhile.

I&#8217;m not advocating you take stupid risks or gamble with your life, but what I am trying to drive home is that sometimes a little risk is involved when it comes to achieving success.

From my perspective some of **the greatest endeavors in history have involved all kinds of risks**. Think about all of the Astronauts in history. Every time one of them straps into a rocket they take the risk of blowing up to help advance mankind.

**You can not let the fear of risk hold you back. **So the next time someone says your idea sounds risky, tell them to **TAKE A FLYING LEAP**.
