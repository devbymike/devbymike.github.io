I am **Mike Key**, a front end developer based in Clearwater, FL. I craft code for [Wihp](http://wihphotels.com), climb mountains, read old books, lift heavy things, eat (mostly) paleo. Sold everything to travel the USA in an Airstream with my wife and daugther.

You can contact me via [email](mailto:mike@mk3y.com) or follow me on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/mike_key), [Github](http://github.com/devbymike).
